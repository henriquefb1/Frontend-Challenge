# Frontend-Challenge
Frontend challenge done for the Jungle Devs internship program.

Design created according to the following original design:
https://www.figma.com/file/iBxoiuoSXy3SiOAnwXo2Np/Frontend-%E2%80%93-Challenge-1?node-id=0%3A2

Notes:
- Challenge finished with only 2 months experience in frontend(self-taught).
- Minor differences between the original and the delivered concept, such as border sizes, gradient colors, etc.
- Code definitelly can be worked in a cleaner and probably more logical way, quite some room for improvement.
- Small normalize.css file added to the challenge, which could have been simply added to the original styles.css, hopefully it won't be a problem.

Please do bear in mind that this has been done while having very little experience, all self-taught, studying for 1/1,5 hours per day while having a very busy routine as a teacher both at school and giving private lessons.

I strongly believe that by joining a supportive and active team, I may be able to improve my skills much faster and bring value back to the company.
